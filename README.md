# MorningMetroMonitor
MMM Checks your usual metro path and drops you a morning Line message about the status.

Uses the Yahoo Japan Transit web page, parses it with BeautifulSoup and checks that my fastest (usual) route is running smooth. And since I'd like to know that *before* leaving the house to bring the kids to school, it pushes me a message on line every morning.
